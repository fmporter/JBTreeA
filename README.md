# JBTreeA: an academic family tree of Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics staff

- - - -

Much of the research done here should be credited to [academictree.org](https://academictree.org/) and [AstroGen](https://astrogen.aas.org/front/index.php) (the Astronomy Genealogy Project), who provide detailed academic family tree data. Both of them are maintained and updated by volunteers, so exploring and adding records to them is encouraged! I'd also like to thank all of the staff who responded to my rather out of the blue emails asking them nosy questions about their supervisors.
